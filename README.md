# Meme-folder
This was meant to be a video, gif, image - gallery viewer displayed in a nice way (mansonry) in which you can organize photos by tags
You can easely check and remove tags from each photo and search them by tags. 
You can use union search which will display all images that has at least one checked tags.
If uncheck will display all the images/videos/gifs that have checked tags (this is the main feature I wanted and couldn't find somewhere else)
